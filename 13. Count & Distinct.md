SQL provides several functions like `count`, `average`,  `sum`, `min` and `max` for aggregating the results of a query. 

# `count` 

> **QUESTION**: Report the total number of payments received before October 28, 2004.

We can use the `count` function to count the number of rows returned for a query.

```sql
select count(*) from payments where paymentDate<"2004-10-28";
```

Output :
```
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|      189 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

# `count` and `distinct`

Another common use case involves counting the number of distinct values in a column.

> **QUESTION**: Report the number of customer who have made payments before October 28, 2004.

We just need to add the `distinct` keyword before a column name.

```sql
select count(distinct customerNumber) from payments where paymentDate<"2004-10-28";
```

Output :
```
+--------------------------------+
| count(distinct customerNumber) |
+--------------------------------+
|                             98 |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

# `distinct`

`distinct` can also be used without `count`.

> **QUESTION**: Retrieve the list of customer numbers for customer who have made a payment before October 28, 2004.

``` sql
select distinct customerNumber from payments where paymentDate<"2004-10-28";
```

Output :
```
